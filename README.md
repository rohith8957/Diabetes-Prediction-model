# Diabetes-Prediction-model
This project analyzes the Diabetes Health Dataset from Kaggle using Python and Machine Learning techniques. The workflow includes data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data visualization, and building a Random Forest Classifier model to predict diabetes diagnosis. The model achieved 91% accuracy and was saved as a .pkl file for deployment.
